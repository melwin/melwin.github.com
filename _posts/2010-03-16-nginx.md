For that fresh new feeling I switched this site from Apache2 to <a href="http://nginx.org">Nginx</a>. A quick compile of the source package and following the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Wordpress">instructions</a> on hooking it up with Wordpress over fastcgi using php-cgi and we're done!

Feels good with a server handling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">C10K</a> problem - and it has a fairly decent configuration language IMHO.

Also looking forward to use Nginx more in the days to come as a the web frontend for development tools server at work hosting, among some things:

<ul>
	<li>Gitorious</li>
	<li>Redmine</li>
	<li>Hudson</li>
	<li>Nexus</li>
</ul>

Will post more about this later!
