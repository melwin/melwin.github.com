More than a full year since last post - this might not be working as well as I had hoped...!

Finding the time and inspiration to write between the day job and private commitments turns out to be a challenge. Instead of seeing this as a failure, however, I will try to learn from the experience and attempt to find a new way of relating to the blog. Perhaps by being less long winded (!) in each post I could get a few more out there. There are still a lot of things going on I would like to capture, but the previous form is clearly not working.

So - let's try to shake things up and see how that works!
