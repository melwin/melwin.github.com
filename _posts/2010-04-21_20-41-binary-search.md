title: "Binary Search"
---

<a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/binary-search-redux-part-1/"/>Mike Taylor</a> noted in a blog post that in the book Programming Pearls it is mentioned that no more than 10% of developers can correctly implement a binary search. Appalling!

Let's see if I am in that 10% or not...

As I've found myself using Ruby more and more lately, I thought I'd try to implement the binary search using that language.

Here's my stab:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/374222.js"></script>

The script includes code to run the binary search through the test cases for the exercise created by <a href="http://www.tiac.net/~sw">Steve Witham</a>. And once the file reading worked - all tests actually passed (or the code incorrectly shows them as passed... ;).

Good training this!
